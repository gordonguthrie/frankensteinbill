# Explanatory notes for Standard Data Operations - Definition

At some point somebody has to specify what data is the subject of this legislation. It has to be turned into an actual database definition.

Normally that's just left as an exercise for the implementor to use their best judgement.

# Speedbumps

Data tends to be underdefined in legislation - a rough handwaving about the sort of thing that needs to be kept. Getting high levels of reuse and joined up government requires more than that tho.

The problem comes with the deepening and implementing of the technical data stores from the raw hand waving description. The definition of a data item expands to include things like APIs to access it, format's its exposed it, procedures to access API keys.

There needs to be one person responsible for the data defintion and all the associated work around it.
