# Explanatory notes for Standard Data Operations - Recourse

If there is to be a database for some purpose, then in most cases there will be people who wish to either be on, or be removed from, that database.

In general legislation will have some definition of `recourse` what steps to take and under what conditions to appeal a decision to add/exclude a person or entity from the data set.

# Speedbumps

The key considerations around `recourse` are:

* where is it written down in law? (because it needs to be there to conform to the rule of law)
* can it be standardised? should there be a generic Data Operations Act that can be applied to it?
* is the appeal process genuinely unique to this area of administration or could a cookie cutter approach be used?
