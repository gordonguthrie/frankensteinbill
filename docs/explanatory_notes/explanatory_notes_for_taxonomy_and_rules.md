# Taxonomy and Rules

## Law'n'order in old Akkadia

This example shows that the relationship between laws and computer systems is structural and not accidental. 4,000 years ago Hamurabi knew nothing of computers.

Laws are written procedures for making decisions - so are computer system specifications.

Hammurabi didn't have a Police National Computer system - but we could write him one easily enough.

This clause defines:
* an element in a taxonomy - the stele contains a list of crimes - this one is just instance.
* a rule - if guilty hang him

## Modern times

The modern example shows best practice for handling taxonomies.

The taxon is declared in primary legislation - parliament cares that there is the concept of criminal offences.

The Minister may by regulation declare that particular offences should be included in the taxon - and the appropriate part of the computer system be updated to facilitiate this. (This is normally trivial, involving adding some entries into a database table, though through the wit and ingenuity of man that need not necessarily be the case).
