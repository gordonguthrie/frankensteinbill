# Frankenstein Act

This is a Frankenstein Bill consisting of fragments of laws from many jurisdictions - both primary and secondary.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Act is to provide an explanatory guide as to how primary and secondary legislation constrains services delivered in whole or in part digitally.

This Frankenstein Act is primarily aimed at policy makers and legislators who are not technical experts. The goal is to draw out implications for different professional practices of common legislative issues. The expectation is that the examples will be provided by technologists, service designers, content designers, organisation designers, testers and service managers.

## Adding Your Own Examples

You can clone this git repo and raise a PR in the normal way. (If you are not a git user you can also email me gordon.guthrie@gov.scot with your examples).

In either case please follow the simple format here - an extract from a piece of legislation (with a link to the whole thing) and then a separate explanation of the issue.

Please read the existing Frankenstein Act to see if there is an existing example. If your example is not different enough from an existing one to warrant a new entry, consider adding it as a variant with a new clause on the Act side and some additional text bringing out the salient differences.

If your legislation is in a language other than English please add both the orginal text and a translation of it. Don't worry too much about legal fidelity of the translation, if anybody does turn this bill into law we are all doomed.
